# caesar

Suite of utilities written in python for running cold atoms experiments. This suite is inspired by the cicero project out of the MIT labs. Consisting of two main parts, caesar interfaces with I/O equipment to provide experiment control and tacitus acts as the data acquisition layer as well as log viewer.

More to come as things develop.
